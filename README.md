Hey there 👋

I’m Achyutha, a Business Analytics graduate based in the US.

I mostly work with data - SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel - turning raw datasets into insights, dashboards, and clear business stories.

This profile is a collection of my analytics projects, experiments, and coursework, including dashboards, predictive models, and a data-driven capstone. Everything here is built as part of my learning and professional growth.
